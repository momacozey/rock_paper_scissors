This is a game of rock paper scissors.  I will be updaiting the html, css, javascript, and the readme along the way.

day 1 i have code put together "that i find to be very ugly"  that will let you choose rock, paper, or scissors.
the computer will also randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors as well.
The console will log the winner and a sentence will also appear in the browser of who won,lost, or tied.

upon doing this project i have realizd where my weakness and knowledge need improved so far.
i plan on adding a main screen with three buttons to choose from at a later date but for today i just want the program up and running while keeping score.
