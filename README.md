This is a game of rock paper scissors.  I will be updaiting the html, css, javascript, and the readme along the way.

day 1 i have code put together "that i find to be very ugly"  that will let you choose rock, paper, or scissors.
the computer will also randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors as well.
The console will log the winner and a sentence will also appear in the browser of who won,lost, or tied.

upon doing this project i have realizd where my weakness and knowledge need improved so far.
i plan on adding a main screen with three buttons to choose from at a later date but for today i just want the program up and running while keeping score.

upon many hours i have seen ways to cleaning up my code and i had to research how to keep count in game.  having zero background in any coding making my first working app feels like a huge success. I am tho very saddened that i had to look so much stuff from other peoples coding but i guess we all have to start somewhere to understand.  i plan to add a front end visual to this game here soon.  that will be a new test with making buttons equal my user input.
